# To-lower-case-in-python


This function takes a string as input and returns a new string where all uppercase letters have been converted to lowercase. It uses a built-in method provided by the programming language to perform the conversion efficiently and correctly for every character in the string. Any characters that are already lowercase or are not letters remain unchanged in the returned string. The function ensures the output string is the lowercase version of the original input.
